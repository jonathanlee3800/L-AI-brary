### About
LibraryBuddies is a chrome extension built to assist users in querying research databases. This chrome extension takes in a natural language prompt from the user and converts it into a search strategy.<br/>
When querying with natural language, the GPT4 model is instructed to convert the user's prompt into a search strategy, by identifying critical themes and main points that will satisfy the user's input.

As a user, you can type a natural language query such as: "Show me the environmental impacts of green energy". You can also highlight a text to use the Generate Insights feature.

In this current build, the LibraryBuddies extension queries the Singapore Management University(SMU)'s library database for resources. Upon installation of this extension, you will be prompted to enter the openAI API key. To use this extension, you will need to have a valid openAI API Key, with access to the GPT-4 model.

### Code
This extension is written in HTML, Javascript.
